# Election Event Logging for GEN-01

There are two CDF instances, which are closely linked. The first `eel-documentation-gen-01` contains a reuseable set of EventId and EventType descriptions. The second file, `eel-gen-01` contains event logs for two devices, both voter-facing scanners in the GEN-01 election. 

> NB: The EventIds and EventTypes are examples and do not represent a normative list of Ids or Types to be used by voting system equipment.
